# FormWizard

FormWizard is a lightweight, easy-to-use gem for creating multi-step forms (wizards) in Ruby on Rails applications. It simplifies the process of building complex forms by handling step navigation, validations, and session management out of the box.

## Features

- Simple DSL for defining steps, attributes, and validations.
- Per-step Validations: Validations run only for the current step.
- Automatic session management: Handles storing and retrieving data between steps.
- Seamless integration: Easily integrates with Rails controllers and views.
- Customizable Navigation: Supports custom logic for next and previous steps.
