          content: To enable two factor authentication, scan the QR code below with your 2FA app (like Google Authenticator or Authy). This will link your user account directly to your 2FA app, generating unique, one-time codes that you'll use for secure access to your account.

          steps:
          - Download an authenticator app on your smartphone if you haven't already.
          - Scan the QR code with your authenticator app.

          content: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds a critical second step to your login process, combining something you know (your password) with something you have (a mobile device or authentication app). This makes it significantly harder for potential intruders to gain access to your account, even if they know your password.

          disable_instructions: To disable two-factor authentication, enter the code generated by your authenticator app.
